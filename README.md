# sql_queries
I created the database General_air_Oct23 within Excel and then imported it to Microsoft SQL Server. I then queried the data for the most relevant information. These queries are for my project for Reliable Auto Sprinkler, all queries were done in Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio. They were then imported to Power BI for visualization.
